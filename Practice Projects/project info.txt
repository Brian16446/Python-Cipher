take input from user of string to decrypt

convert into list for each word

so might have to do something like if it finds a space, assign the subsequent values to a new list

at this point you will have a list of words

then you will have to count each character in each list to get how big each word is.

so then you should have a list of lists; a list of all the words and a list of all the values of the words.

then sort the list starting with the biggest word at index 0 

then take the first element of list which should be the biggest word and make a for loop which iterates each character by n+1 each time it loops and checks the result against a word file containing each word.

if the value does not match anything contained in the word file, move on to the next index (the second biggest word) and so on until it works

then whichever number the loop hit, store that number and that number is the key.
